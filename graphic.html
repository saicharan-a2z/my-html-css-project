        <h1>GAME DESIGNING</h1>
    </div>
    <p>A game concept is an idea for a game, briefly describing its core play mechanisms, objectives, themes, and who the players represent.
       A game concept may be pitched to a game publisher in a similar manner as film ideas are pitched to potential film producers. Alternatively, game publishers holding a game license to intellectual property in other media may solicit game concepts from several designers before picking one to design a game.
        During design, a game concept is fleshed out. Mechanisms are specified in terms of components (boards, cards, tokens, etc.) and rules. The play sequence and possible player actions are defined, as well as how the game starts, ends, and win conditions (if any).</p>
